          fortification created to protect the borders of the Chinese Empire from invading Mongols. The Great Wall is

          concrete-and-soapstone statue was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost approximately $250,000 to build -
          much of the money was raised through donations. The statue has become an easily recognized icon for Rio and

          thought by scholars to have been a sacred archaeological center for the nearby Incan capital of Cusco. Built
          at
          the peak of the Incan Empire in the mid-1400s, this mountain citadel was later abandoned by the Incas. The
          site
          remained unknown except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by archaeologist Hiram Bingham. The
          site
          can only be reached by foot, train or helicopter; most visitors visit by train from nearby Cusco.</td>

          city, a trading center for cloth, slaves, honey and salt, flourished from approximately 800 to 1200, and acted

          it
          was in use for some 500 years. The elliptical structure sat nearly 50,000 spectators, who gathered to watch
          the
          gladiatorial events as well as other public spectacles, including battle reenactments, animal hunts and
          executions. Earthquakes and stone-robbers have left the Colosseum in a state of ruin, but portions of the
          structure remain open to tourists, and its design still influences the construction of modern-day
          amphitheaters,

          represents a number of architectural styles, including Persian, Islamic, Turkish and Indian. The Taj Mahal

          experts
          in manipulating water technology, constructing intricate tunnels and water chambers, which helped create an
          pseudo-oasis. A number of incredible structures carved into stone, a 4,000-seat amphitheater and the El-Deir
          monastery have also helped the site earn its fame.</td>
